Note: I have left the formatting to you.

State the purpose of your application clearly and concisely. Try to do it in a single sentence.

Answer the following questions as you did in your Group Project:
##### What is the problem you are trying to solve?
Memory is flawed. Over time you will forget details of important events. Details you'd like to remember. Introducing: The diary! Write things down so you can later look back and check the facts and relive them.

##### Who is your target audience?
Humans. (@robots this is not for you)

##### What are your specific goals?
To be able to create records of days/events by date, for people, for locations, and tie the days/events to the people and locations. It needs to be possible to search those records based on date/people/locations, to allow easy verification and updating. It also needs to be possible to update the records, to ensure that more information can be added when so desired.

In another block, answer the following:
##### What is your business model? Where is your revenue coming from?
The app is based on the freemium model. First users can sign up and use the app for free, and when enough traction has been created, costs for signing up can be implemented.

##### What are the costs of your business?
Domain, hosting, maintenance.

Market research:
##### Who is your current competition?
The main competitors allow you to create pages for your diary, but do not allow you to link to, or even record, people and locations. This means that it can be very challenging to find events from years past.

##### How is your product different from currently available competitors?
As described above.

##### What is the current supply / demand for your product?
The supply is currently just this product, as soon as it goes live. The demand grows for each memory that becomes fuzzy and every Christmas dinner argument that leads to the tables being flipped over and turkeys being used as juicy projectiles.

Technical Specifications:
##### What data will you need to store? How will it be organized? Describe each table, its columns, and its relationships with other tables.
A user table for registering users.
A sessions table for keeping track of the users sessions, allowing them to log in and access only their own data.
A pages table, belonging to users, linked to people and locations.
A people table, belonging to users, linked to pages.
A locations table, belonging to users, linked to pages.

##### What does your product look like? List each view, their purpose, and how they work
A view where users can sign up.
A view where signed up users can log in.
A view where logged in users can create, filter, edit pages.
A view where logged in users can create, filter, edit people.
A view where logged in users can create, filter, edit locations.

##### Describe any complex business logic that is happening in your application. For example, how does data flow through your application
Pages can only link people and locations that have already been created.

Have a timeline of milestones to reach, including deadlines:
##### Create milestones that represent the discrete blocks of functionality.
##### Give an estimate for how long each will take per engineer.
##### Determine whether things can be built concurrently.

- Have the different views (1d)
- Be able to record pages people, locations (1d)
- Be able to link pages to people and locations (1d)
- Be able to register (0.5d)
- Be able to log in (0.5d)
- Be able to only view your data (1d)

##### Come up with a timeline of goals to stick to.
- Finish the first half before the group project
- Finish the last half after the group project
